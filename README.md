# SoDo Sans for Pyoncord/Bunny

SoDo Sans is a font commissioned for Starbucks for their branding. It also looks clean as hell.

## Installation

Copy the link to the JSON file.\
Open your Pyoncord/Bunny client, go to Settings, scroll down to Fonts, tap the Plus (+) icon, **Import font entries from a link**, paste the link in the **Font Link** text box, then **Import**. You will have to scroll down and hit **Import** again.\
After that, you will be brought back to the **Fonts** screen. Tap the checkbox next to SoDo Sans. After this, you will have to force close then reopen Discord for it to take effect.\
After that, you're done! :)

## Disclaimer

I don't own SoDo Sans, as Starbucks does. However, this repository isn't meant for commercial use, it's for *personal use only.*
